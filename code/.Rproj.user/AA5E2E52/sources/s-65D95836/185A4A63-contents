# Abstract

## Background
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a type of cancer that is common in South East Asia with a very low postmetastasic survival rate. Clinical trials were conducted at the National Cancer Centre Singapore in order to evaluate the response of postmetastasic NPC tumours to the drug gemcitabine in patients with and without prior chemotherapy exposure.

## Methods
A Bayesian statistical framework was used in order to combine prior knowledge elicited from clinicians and study collaborators with data from the trials in order to allow for a more informed analysis. The Simon two-stage minimax design was used in order to define the futility guidelines, with the desired and undesired response proportions being 0.3 and 0.1 (0.2 and 0.05 for the chemotherapy exposed group). Clinical priors were designed such that there would be equal probability ($1/3$)  of response proportions being greater than desired, less than undesired and between both parameters. Priors were also elicited from collaborators, who postulated that the mean (SD) response proportion for both groups would be $1/3$ (0.24).

## Results
After combining the two stages, the response rate for the naive (exposed) group was 13/27 (7/25). Using the Bayesian framework and the clinical (collaborator) prior, the posterior probability that the response was higher in the exposed group was 91% (93%). The probability of being below the undesired proportion was less than 1% for both priors after only the first stage, and would have resulted in futility guidelines being met before initiating stage 2 for the exposed group.
	
## Conclusions
Gemcitabine is highly likely to be more effective than placebo in treating postmetastasic NPC in patients with previous chemotherapy experience.

# Appendix

## Question 1


```{r q1, echo = T, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}

collab_mean <- 1/3
collab_var <- .2357^2

# Use system of equations to solve for alpha and beta
alpha <- ((1-collab_mean)/collab_var - 1/collab_mean) * collab_mean^2
beta <- alpha*(1/collab_mean - 1)
priordf <- data.table(ind = seq(1e-4, 1-1e-4, 1e-4))
priordf[, dens := dbeta(ind, shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta)]

ggplot(priordf) + geom_line(aes(x = ind, y = dens), color = 'blue') + theme_classic() + labs(x = expression(theta), y = 'Density')

```

Solving the system of equations describing the mean and variance of the beta distribution find __$\beta$(`r alpha %>% round`, `r beta %>% round`)__ to most closely represent the information provided by the collaborator.

## Questions 2 and 3

When calculating the posterior probability in the regions of interest using the Stage 1 data and the Stage 2 data separately, we are able to replicate what they report for the Stage 1 posterior in Tables 1 and 2. However, our results for the Stage 2 posterior (based on the Stage 2 data alone), does not replicate their Stage 2 posterior results. Calculating the Stage 2 posterior using only the Stage 2 data does not replicate the paper because the analysis in the paper used the combined data for Stages 1 and 2 to calculate the Stage 2 posterior.

As such, the results in the attempted replicate of Table 2 cannot be compared to those from Table 2 of the original paper using the other types of priors. We instead should making the comparison to these results in _Question 4.2_, as this is the analysis in which we used the combined data from both Stage 1 and Stage 2 of each trial.

## Question 4

1. The threshold for effectiveness for gemcitabine in Trial P was observation of at least 4 successes out of the total of 27 patients. After Stage 1, there are already 7 observed successes, so effectiveness can be concluded. The probability that effectiveness will still be the conclusion after Stage 2 is 1.

```{r q41, echo = T}

## 4.1

#Trial C, clinical prior
a <- 0.7 + 3
b <- 2.1 + 12
tan_succ <- pbetap(ab = c(a,b), n=10, s=3:10) %>% sum
#Trial C, collaborator prior
a <- 1 + 3
b <- 2 + 12
collab_succ <- pbetap(ab = c(a,b), n=10, s=3:10) %>% sum

succdf <- data.table(trial = c("p", "c"), tan_prior = c(1, tan_succ), collab_prior = c(1, collab_succ))

kable(succdf, caption = 'Posterior Predictive Probabilities of Success After Phase I')
```

2. Using the combined data we observe that in patients previously treated with chemotherapy, the posterior probability of the desired response rate $r_1$ is nearly 1, suggesting that gemcitabine is highly effective in this patient population. The same confidence cannot be attributed to patients who have not been previously treated with chemotherapy.

```{r q42, echo = T}
## 4.2

combdf <- rbind(rep_p[, .(range, new_s1_s2_post, trial = 'p')],
                rep_c[, .(range, new_s1_s2_post, trial = 'c')])

combdf <- dcast(combdf, range~paste0('trial_', trial), value.var = 'new_s1_s2_post')

kable(combdf, caption = 'Posterior probabilities of regions of interest using combined data from each trial')

```

```{r q43, echo = T}
## 4.3
n_samples <- 1e4
tan_post_p <- rbeta(n_samples, clinical_alpha_p + 13, clinical_beta_p + 14)
tan_post_c <- rbeta(n_samples, clinical_alpha_c + 7, clinical_beta_c + 18)

tan_p_gte_c <- sum((tan_post_p - tan_post_c) >= 0)/n_samples

new_post_p <- rbeta(n_samples, alpha + 13, beta + 14)
new_post_c <- rbeta(n_samples, alpha + 7, beta + 18)

new_p_gte_c <- sum((new_post_p - new_post_c) >= 0)/n_samples

```

3. We find that $P(\theta_P\leq\theta_C|D)$ is `r round(tan_p_gte_c, 3)` when using the original clinical prior from the study and `r round(new_p_gte_c, 3)` when using the new prior from our collaborator. Both results strongly suggest that gemcitabine is more effective in patients previously treated with chemotherapy than in treatment naive patients.
